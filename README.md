   - Database – Structured storage of data.
   - Data Entry – Manual input of data into systems.
   - Filtering – Narrowing data to show specific values.
   - Dashboard – Visual summary of data insights.
   - Data Cleaning – Correcting or removing inaccurate records.

4. **Data Sources**

   - Internal and external sources such as surveys, reports, social media, and databases.

5. **Methods of Data Collection**

   - Primary: Surveys, interviews.
   - Secondary: Online sources, reports, publications.

6. **Data Types**
