   - Understanding the process of inspecting, cleaning, transforming, and modeling data.

2. **Importance of Data Analysis**

   - Making informed decisions, identifying patterns, and driving business growth through data.

3. **Key Terminologies:**

   - Data – Raw facts or figures.
   - Dataset – Collection of related data.
   - Data Point – Single piece of data in a dataset.
   - Insights – Actionable information derived from data analysis.
   - Database – Structured storage of data.
   - Data Entry – Manual input of data into systems.
   - Filtering – Narrowing data to show specific values.
   - Dashboard – Visual summary of data insights.
   - Data Cleaning – Correcting or removing inaccurate records.

4. **Data Sources**

   - Internal and external sources such as surveys, reports, social media, and databases.

5. **Methods of Data Collection**

   - Primary: Surveys, interviews.
   - Secondary: Online sources, reports, publications.

6. **Data Types**

   - Qualitative and Quantitative (Discrete, Continuous)

7. **Data Visualization**

   - Representing data graphically to identify trends and patterns.

8. **Pivot Tables and Charts**

   - Creating dynamic summaries of data using PivotTables.
   - Generating visual insights using charts.

 - **Common Excel Charts Covered:**

   - Bar/Column Charts – Comparison across categories.
   - Pie Charts – Part-to-whole relationships.
   - Line Charts – Trends over time.
   - Combo Charts – Combining two chart types for dual analysis.
